# FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT WITH PYTHON- TECHWAVE 
Hi I made this project during Full Stack development with Python Training program, conducted by <b>TechWave</b>.

## Project Title: Tic Tac Toe with AI

## About the project: Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game for two players that we enjoyed playing as kids (especially in boring classrooms). The game involves 2 players placing their respective symbols in a 3x3 grid. The player who manages to place three of their symbols in horizontal/vertical/diagonal row wins the game.

## Tech Stack used: Python


## How the game goes on: This algorithm thinks a few steps ahead and positions itself in the position of its adversary, much like a skilled chess player. It continues to play ahead until it reaches a terminal board configuration (terminal state), which can produce a tie, a win, or a loss. Once in a terminal condition, the AI will arbitrarily give a win ( a positive score ), a defeat ( a negative score ) or a draw ((0) a neutral score).
